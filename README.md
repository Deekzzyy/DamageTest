# About the project (Sobre o projeto)


This project is a part of a OneBitCode training where the goal is fulfil the following condicionals:

- If the attack power is bigger than the defense power and the enemy doesn't have a shield, the damage caused will be equal the difference between the attack and defense.
  
- If the attack power is bigger than the defense power and the enemy have a shield, the damage caused will be equal the difference between the attack and defense divided by two.
  
- If the attack power is less than the defense power and the enemy have a shield, you can't hit the enemy.

Doing this project helps me to improve my logic skills with condicionals, functions, the divs' control, use of labels and inputs and CSS skills.
